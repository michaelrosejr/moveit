# MoveIT - Automated way to disable an Aruba RAP when an employee is terminated


This project automates disabling a Remote AP when an employee or contractor has been terminated. In Microbranch / IAPVPN solutions, customers have concerns that Remote APs are still connected to the company network after an employee has been terminated. This project uses our APIs to receive notification from ServiceNow/Workday/Active Directory and queries the ClearPass and Central for the necessary information to disable the Remote AP
